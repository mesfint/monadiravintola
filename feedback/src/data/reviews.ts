We sat on the small terrace that they have. They even welcomed my dog. The people working were very friendly. I highly recommend this place for all.',

    text: "The service was quick and friendly, and the restaurant was clean. We tried their pasta, and we absolutely loved it! The Panna Cotta and Tiramisu were particularly delightful; they had just the right amount of sweetness, and the tiramisu didn't overpower with a strong coffee taste. üëçüèºüëçüèº We will definitely go back to try more of their dishes. üòÅ",

    text: "I ordered my food for delivery, I am unable to rate the Atmosphere. From order to delivery, service was faster than expected. The pizza itself was excellent. Crust has a nice little char to it, perfectly cooked. Sauce to cheese ratio was perfect to my liking. Pepperoni had a nice little spicy kick. I really enjoyed this pizza quite a bit. Really wish is was pre-sliced, but I am from USA so kinda used to the pizza pre-sliced. Still didn't take away from the overall experience. Great Service, very fresh and excellent pizza. Thank you very much for everyone involved. Would order again!",
